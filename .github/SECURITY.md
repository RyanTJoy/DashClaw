## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately.

- Include: steps to reproduce, impacted endpoints/components, and any relevant logs/redacted payloads

## Scope Notes

- Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.
- If your report includes secrets, redact them (DashClaw includes DLP redaction, but assume logs/screenshots can leak).
