## [Unreleased]

### Added
- None yet.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Real-Time SSE Events**: New `POLICY_UPDATED`, `TASK_ASSIGNED`, `TASK_COMPLETED` event types emitted from policy CRUD and task routing routes.
- **SDK `events()` method**: SSE client for agents to subscribe to real-time events (Node SDK only, zero dependencies).
- **SSE-based `waitForApproval()`**: New `useEvents: true` option for instant approval resolution instead of polling.
- **Client-side SSE listeners**: `useRealtime` hook now handles `policy.updated`, `task.assigned`, `task.completed` events.
- **Digest repository**: Extracted digest queries from route into `digest.repository.js`.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-15

### Security
- **Deep Security Audit**: Comprehensive 5-agent parallel audit across auth, input validation, secrets, network surface, and AI governance risks. Resolved 4 CRITICAL, 9 HIGH, and 8 MEDIUM severity findings.
- **SSRF Protection for Task Routing**: `dispatchToAgent()` and `fireCallback()` now validate URLs with DNS resolution, private IP blocking, HTTPS enforcement, and redirect prevention — matching the existing webhook SSRF protections.
- **Agent Signature Enforcement**: Signatures are now enforced by default in production (`ENFORCE_AGENT_SIGNATURES`). Opt out explicitly with `=false`.
- **Closed Agent Enrollment**: New `DASHCLAW_CLOSED_ENROLLMENT=true` mode requires agents to be pre-registered before submitting actions.
- **Timing-Safe Secret Comparison**: All 5 cron routes now use a shared `timingSafeCompare` utility. Middleware timing-safe function improved to prevent length leaks.
- **Cron Auth Fix**: `/api/cron/routing-maintenance` was missing `CRON_SECRET` validation while being publicly routable — now secured consistently with all other cron endpoints.
- **Rate Limit Bypass Fix**: `x-real-ip` header is no longer trusted unless `TRUST_PROXY=true`, preventing attackers from spoofing IPs to bypass rate limits.
- **Request Body Size Limit**: 2 MB maximum enforced in middleware for all POST/PUT/PATCH requests.
- **SDK HTTPS Warnings**: Both Node and Python SDKs now warn when `baseUrl` does not use HTTPS, preventing plaintext API key transmission.
- **Markdown XSS Prevention**: Agent messages rendered via `ReactMarkdown` now block `javascript:` and other unsafe URL schemes in links.
- **Demo Cookie Bypass Fix**: The `dashclaw_demo` cookie no longer activates demo mode on self-hosted deployments — only honored when `DASHCLAW_MODE=demo`.
- **Invite URL Hardening**: Invite link generation now uses `NEXTAUTH_URL` as the canonical origin instead of trusting `x-forwarded-host`.
- **Input Validation Hardening**: Agent-reported `risk_score` clamped to 0-100, cost/token values bounded to safe maximums, routing agent registration validates endpoint URLs and input ranges.
- **Leaked Key Cleanup**: Removed accidental API key from `.next/standalone/.env` build artifact. Added `.dockerignore` to prevent future leaks.

### Added
- **Startup Environment Validation**: New `validateEnv.js` module warns on missing configuration and errors on critical production misconfigurations (OAuth, API key, encryption key).
- **Guard Fallback Control**: New `DASHCLAW_GUARD_FALLBACK` env var to globally configure semantic guard behavior when LLM is unavailable (`allow` or `block`).
- **SSE Connection Limits**: Server-side 30-minute max duration for SSE streams with bounded deduplication set (10,000 entries max).

### Changed
- **OAuth Provider Registration**: Providers are now conditionally registered based on available credentials. Production deployments without any OAuth configuration log an error at startup instead of silently using mock values.
- **HSTS Header**: Upgraded to `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` (2-year max-age with preload).
- **Source Maps**: Explicitly disabled browser source maps in production builds.
- **Sync Validation**: All Zod array validators in the bulk sync schema now enforce `.max()` bounds matching the runtime `LIMITS` constants, rejecting oversized payloads at parse time.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **One-click Agent Pairing**: New pairing flow for verified agents (agents request enrollment, admins approve via a click link or `/pairings` inbox).
- **Pairing APIs**: `/api/pairings` endpoints to create, list, fetch, and approve pairing requests.
- **Pairings UI**: `/pair/:pairingId` approval page and `/pairings` inbox (includes Approve All for 50+ agents).

### Changed
- **Canonical Signing**: Agent action signatures now use canonical JSON (stable key ordering / no whitespace) to prevent flaky signature failures.
- **Signature Enforcement Control**: Signature enforcement is now controlled via `ENFORCE_AGENT_SIGNATURES=true` (instead of implicitly depending on `NODE_ENV`).

## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Adaptive Learning Loop MVP**: Added episode scoring and recommendation synthesis for agent performance improvement over time.
- **Learning Recommendations API**: New endpoint `/api/learning/recommendations` with role-gated rebuild support (`POST`) and recommendation retrieval (`GET`).
- **Learning Loop Cron Jobs**: Added scheduled endpoints for automated learning maintenance:
  - `/api/cron/learning-episodes-backfill`
  - `/api/cron/learning-recommendations`
- **SDK Recommendation Methods**:
  - Node SDK: `getRecommendations()`, `rebuildRecommendations()`, `recommendAction()`
  - Python SDK: `get_recommendations()`, `rebuild_recommendations()`, `recommend_action()`

### Changed
- **Action Outcome Pipeline**: `PATCH /api/actions/[actionId]` now best-effort scores learning episodes for adaptive recommendation generation.
- **Operational Scripts**: Added learning-loop migration/backfill/rebuild scripts and npm commands for repeatable operations.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Governance**: New "Approval Queue" dashboard at `/approvals` for real-time human intervention in agent workflows.
- **Pending Approval State**: Actions triggered by `require_approval` policies now pause in a dedicated state until an administrator approves or denies them.
- **SDK Blocking & Polling**: Node.js and Python SDKs now support `hitlMode: 'wait'`, allowing agents to automatically pause and wait for human decisions.
- **Approval API**: New endpoint `POST /api/actions/[actionId]/approve` for centralized decision management.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Swarm Intelligence**: New visual dashboard at `/swarm` for decision visibility across multi-agent communication maps and operational risk.
- **Swarm Graph API**: New endpoint `/api/swarm/graph` providing node-link data for large agent swarms (up to 50+ agents).
- **Communication Topology**: Visual mapping of agent-to-agent message flow with risk-based node highlighting.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Proactive Memory Maintenance**: New server-side cron job that identifies stale assumptions and conflicting decisions.
- **Memory Correction Messages**: System-to-agent messaging that suggests specific memory pruning and verification tasks.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-13

### Added
