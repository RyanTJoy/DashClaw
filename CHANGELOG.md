# DashClaw Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-25

### Changed
- **Fleet Presence Sizing**: Updated the default dashboard layout to render `Agent Fleet Presence` as a taller 2x4 tile (`w:2, h:4`) for better list visibility and scrolling.
- **Preset Layout Alignment**: Updated `Operations Focus`, `Analytics Focus`, and `Compact Overview` presets to use the same `fleet-presence` 2x4 size and adjusted neighboring tile coordinates to prevent overlap.
- **Layout Versioning**: Incremented dashboard layout state version to `v8` so clients refresh to the new default geometry.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Local Admin Password Authentication**: Implemented a local password login mode controlled by the `DASHCLAW_LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable, providing a full alternative to OAuth for self-hosted deployments.
- **Local Session Management**: Added a secure, JWT-backed local session system that integrates with the existing middleware and sign-out logic.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **Fleet Presence Merge**: Resolved an issue where agents with heartbeats but no action records were excluded from the dashboard fleet list.
- **Online Detection Fallback**: Improved `isOnline` logic to use `last_active` and `status` as a fallback when `last_heartbeat_at` is missing.
- **Layout Versioning**: Incremented layout state version (v5) to ensure all users receive the updated newspaper-style hierarchy.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **ScoringProfileCard Layout**: Fixed a bug where the card collapsed during loading (rendering null) and failed to fill its grid cell. Now uses `CardSkeleton` and `h-full` for consistent grid alignment.
- **Preset Layout Refinement**: Refined the distribution of newer tiles (Evaluation, Feedback, Drift, Scoring) in the default preset and updated md/sm breakpoints for better density.
- **Layout Versioning**: Incremented layout state version (v4) to trigger a fresh layout load for all users.

- **Tile Visibility Toggle**: New "Customize" dashboard modal allowing users to show/hide individual tiles.
- **Persistent Visibility State**: User-level dashboard customization saved to `localStorage`, allowing for a decluttered operational view.
- **Layout Versioning**: Incremented layout state version (v3) to ensure a seamless migration to the redesigned grid for all users.

### Changed

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-15

### Security
- **Deep Security Audit**: Comprehensive 5-agent parallel audit across auth, input validation, secrets, network surface, and AI governance risks. Resolved 4 CRITICAL, 9 HIGH, and 8 MEDIUM severity findings.
- **SSRF Protection for Task Routing**: `dispatchToAgent()` and `fireCallback()` now validate URLs with DNS resolution, private IP blocking, HTTPS enforcement, and redirect prevention — matching the existing webhook SSRF protections.
- **Agent Signature Enforcement**: Signatures are now enforced by default in production (`ENFORCE_AGENT_SIGNATURES`). Opt out explicitly with `=false`.
- **Closed Agent Enrollment**: New `DASHCLAW_CLOSED_ENROLLMENT=true` mode requires agents to be pre-registered before submitting actions.
- **Timing-Safe Secret Comparison**: All 5 cron routes now use a shared `timingSafeCompare` utility. Middleware timing-safe function improved to prevent length leaks.
- **Cron Auth Fix**: `/api/cron/routing-maintenance` was missing `CRON_SECRET` validation while being publicly routable — now secured consistently with all other cron endpoints.
- **Rate Limit Bypass Fix**: `x-real-ip` header is no longer trusted unless `TRUST_PROXY=true`, preventing attackers from spoofing IPs to bypass rate limits.
- **Request Body Size Limit**: 2 MB maximum enforced in middleware for all POST/PUT/PATCH requests.
- **SDK HTTPS Warnings**: Both Node and Python SDKs now warn when `baseUrl` does not use HTTPS, preventing plaintext API key transmission.
- **Markdown XSS Prevention**: Agent messages rendered via `ReactMarkdown` now block `javascript:` and other unsafe URL schemes in links.
- **Demo Cookie Bypass Fix**: The `dashclaw_demo` cookie no longer activates demo mode on self-hosted deployments — only honored when `DASHCLAW_MODE=demo`.
- **Invite URL Hardening**: Invite link generation now uses `NEXTAUTH_URL` as the canonical origin instead of trusting `x-forwarded-host`.
- **Input Validation Hardening**: Agent-reported `risk_score` clamped to 0-100, cost/token values bounded to safe maximums, routing agent registration validates endpoint URLs and input ranges.
- **Leaked Key Cleanup**: Removed accidental API key from `.next/standalone/.env` build artifact. Added `.dockerignore` to prevent future leaks.

### Added
- **Startup Environment Validation**: New `validateEnv.js` module warns on missing configuration and errors on critical production misconfigurations (OAuth, API key, encryption key).
- **Guard Fallback Control**: New `DASHCLAW_GUARD_FALLBACK` env var to globally configure semantic guard behavior when LLM is unavailable (`allow` or `block`).
- **SSE Connection Limits**: Server-side 30-minute max duration for SSE streams with bounded deduplication set (10,000 entries max).

### Changed
- **OAuth Provider Registration**: Providers are now conditionally registered based on available credentials. Production deployments without any OAuth configuration log an error at startup instead of silently using mock values.
- **HSTS Header**: Upgraded to `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` (2-year max-age with preload).
- **Source Maps**: Explicitly disabled browser source maps in production builds.
- **Sync Validation**: All Zod array validators in the bulk sync schema now enforce `.max()` bounds matching the runtime `LIMITS` constants, rejecting oversized payloads at parse time.

### Changed
- **Canonical Signing**: Agent action signatures now use canonical JSON (stable key ordering / no whitespace) to prevent flaky signature failures.
