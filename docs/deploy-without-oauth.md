# Deploy DashClaw in Under 10 Minutes — No OAuth Required

This is the full path from zero to a live governance dashboard with a real agent
reporting decisions. No GitHub OAuth app. No Google Cloud Console. Just a password
and a deploy button.

---

## What You Need

- A free [Neon](https://neon.tech) account (Postgres database)
- A free [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account
- A GitHub account (to fork the repo — you will not use it for OAuth)
- 10 minutes

---

## Step 1 — Fork the Repo

Go to [github.com/ucsandman/DashClaw](https://github.com/ucsandman/DashClaw) and
click **Fork**. Accept all defaults. This gives you your own copy to deploy from.

---

## Step 2 — Create a Free Database

1. Sign up at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Create a new project — name it anything, e.g. `dashclaw`
3. Copy the connection string. It looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://user:pass@ep-xyz.neon.tech/neondb
   ```
   You will paste this in the next step.

---

## Step 3 — Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Import your forked DashClaw repository
3. Before clicking Deploy, open the **Environment Variables** panel and add these:

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `DATABASE_URL` | Your Neon connection string from Step 2 |
   | `NEXTAUTH_URL` | `https://your-app.vercel.app` (use your actual Vercel URL) |
   | `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Run the command below and paste the output |
   | `DASHCLAW_API_KEY` | Run the command below and paste the output |
   | `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Run the command below and paste the output |
   | `CRON_SECRET` | Run the command below and paste the output |
   | `DASHCLAW_LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | A strong password of your choice |
   | `DASHCLAW_MODE` | `self_host` |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHCLAW_MODE` | `self_host` |

   Generate the four secrets in one command:
   ```bash
   node -e "const c=require('crypto');console.log('NEXTAUTH_SECRET='+c.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'));console.log('DASHCLAW_API_KEY=oc_live_'+c.randomBytes(24).toString('hex'));console.log('ENCRYPTION_KEY='+c.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url').slice(0,32));console.log('CRON_SECRET='+c.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```

4. Click **Deploy**

Vercel will build and deploy. Tables are created automatically on the first request.
No migrations to run manually.

---

## Step 4 — Sign In With Your Password

1. Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard`
2. You will be redirected to the login page
3. You will see a password field below any OAuth buttons — enter the password you
   set as `DASHCLAW_LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
4. You are in

No GitHub OAuth app. No redirect URIs. No client secrets. Just your password.

---

## Step 5 — Complete Onboarding

The dashboard walks you through four steps automatically:

1. **Create a workspace** — give your org a name, e.g. "My Agent Fleet"
2. **Generate an API key** — this is what your agents use to authenticate
3. **Install the SDK** — one npm or pip install
4. **Record your first action** — paste a snippet into your agent and run it

The onboarding checklist tracks your progress and shows you exactly what to do next.

---

## Step 6 — Connect Your First Agent

Install the SDK on any machine where your agent runs:

```bash
npm install dashclaw
```

Create a file called `agent.js`:

```javascript
import DashClaw from 'dashclaw';

const dc = new DashClaw({
  baseUrl: 'https://your-app.vercel.app',
  apiKey: 'oc_live_...' // the key from Step 5
});

await dc.createAction({
  agentId: 'my-first-agent',
  type: 'api_call',
  declared_goal: 'Fetch user data from CRM',
  risk_score: 20,
});

console.log('Action recorded. Check your dashboard.');
```

Run it:

```bash
node agent.js
```

Go back to your dashboard. The action appears in real time.

---

## Step 7 — Verify Sign-Out Works

Click your avatar or the sign-out button in the dashboard header. You should be
redirected to the login page. Visiting `/dashboard` again should require your
password. If it does, the session is clearing correctly.

---

## What You Just Proved

- DashClaw deploys to Vercel on the free tier with no OAuth setup
- A password is sufficient to protect a self-hosted instance
- An agent can report decisions to your dashboard in under a minute
- The entire thing — database, hosting, auth, and first agent — costs $0

---

## When to Add OAuth

Add GitHub or Google OAuth when you want to invite teammates. Go to
**Settings** in your dashboard, add your OAuth credentials, and both login methods
will be available on the login page. Your password login continues to work alongside
OAuth — you do not have to remove it.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Password field does not appear on login page**
`DASHCLAW_LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is not set, or the deployment did not pick up the
new env var. Go to Vercel → your project → Settings → Environment Variables, confirm
the variable is there, then trigger a redeploy.

**"Incorrect password" error**
Double-check for leading or trailing spaces in the env var. Vercel sometimes adds
whitespace if you paste with line breaks. Copy the value, paste it into a text editor,
confirm it looks right, then save it again in Vercel and redeploy.

**Dashboard loads but shows no data**
This is normal on a fresh instance. Complete the onboarding checklist and connect
an agent. Data appears as soon as an agent sends its first action.

**Tables were not created automatically**
Visit `/api/health` on your deployment. If it returns an error about missing tables,
visit `/api/setup/status` — the app runs migrations on first boot and this endpoint
can trigger them manually.
