# RFC: DashClaw Reliability And Platform Convergence

- RFC ID: RFC-2026-02-13-platform-convergence
- Status: In execution (approval pending)
- Date: February 13, 2026
- Horizon: 12 weeks (February 16, 2026 to May 8, 2026)

  - Full rewrite of all endpoints.
  - New product features unrelated to platform stability.
  - Deprecation of experimental APIs in this cycle.

  4. April 10, 2026: CI guard blocks new direct `sql` usage in route handlers.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - 0 new direct `sql` calls in `app/api/**/route.js` after April 10, 2026.
  - 100% of critical-domain handlers use repository layer.
  - Repository contract test pass rate is 100% in CI.
  - No p95 regression greater than 10% on migrated endpoints.

### WS2: API Contract Governance

  3. March 20, 2026: Reconnect and `Last-Event-ID` replay window shipped.
  4. March 27, 2026: Production cutover complete.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Multi-instance SSE delivery success rate at or above 99.9% in load test.
  - Reconnect replay restores missed events within 60 seconds for short disconnects.
  - No duplicate event processing beyond idempotency tolerance (0.1% max).
  - Rollback plan tested in staging and documented.

### WS4: Documentation Governance

- Owner: DevEx Lead
- Timeline: February 16, 2026 to March 20, 2026
- Goal: Enforce canonical doc hierarchy and prevent version drift.
- Milestones:
  1. February 20, 2026: Canonical hierarchy ratified (`PROJECT_DETAILS.md` and ADR precedence).
  2. March 6, 2026: Doc metadata headers added (`source-of-truth`, `last-verified`, `owner`).
  3. March 13, 2026: CI checks for link validity and version consistency enabled.
  4. March 20, 2026: `README.md` trimmed to onboarding and canonical links.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - 0 unresolved version conflicts across canonical docs in CI checks.
  - 100% architecture docs include metadata headers.
  - Broken link check pass rate is 100%.
  - Contributor guide includes doc update protocol.

### WS5: SDK Core Parity

- Owner: SDK Lead
- Timeline: February 23, 2026 to May 8, 2026
- Goal: Achieve Node/Python parity for critical domains.
- Milestones:
  1. March 6, 2026: `docs/sdk-parity.md` baseline matrix published.
  2. March 27, 2026: Python SDK parity for `actions`, `approvals`, `guard`, `webhooks`.
  3. April 17, 2026: Python parity for `context`, `memory`, `messages`.
  4. May 8, 2026: Cross-SDK integration suite and release.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Critical parity matrix completion is 100%.
  - Shared integration tests pass for Node and Python clients against the same harness.
  - SDK docs include parity guarantees and version compatibility policy.
  - Release notes include migration guidance for changed behavior.

## 5. Cross-Cutting SLO Deliverables

- Acceptance criteria:
  - Action approval roundtrip p95 dashboard live and alerting configured (target under 2 seconds, excluding human wait).
  - Webhook first-attempt p95 dashboard live (target under 5 seconds) and retry observability configured.
  - Signal freshness dashboards live (critical <= 5 minutes, non-critical <= 15 minutes).
  - Error budgets defined and reviewed weekly.

| WS1 | `partial` | SQL drift guard and repository contract tests are in CI (`scripts/check-route-sql-guard.mjs`, `__tests__/unit/repositories.contract.test.js`), but p95 regression target is not yet documented. |
| WS2 | `met` | OpenAPI generation/check and route maturity inventory are active (`scripts/generate-openapi.mjs`, `scripts/check-openapi-diff.mjs`, `docs/api-inventory.md`), and stable breaking-change RFC-tag override workflow is codified in `docs/openapi/README.md`. |
| WS3 | `partial` | Broker/replay/cutover controls and runbook shipped (`app/lib/events.js`, `docs/rfcs/2026-02-13-sse-cutover-runbook.md`), but load-test and duplicate-rate SLO evidence is not yet captured in docs. |
| WS4 | `met` | Governance hierarchy, metadata headers, and CI doc checks are in place (`docs/documentation-governance.md`, `scripts/validate-docs.mjs`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). |
| WS5 | `met` | Cross-SDK integration harness and release closeout are complete (`scripts/check-sdk-cross-integration.mjs`, `sdk-python/tests/test_ws5_m4_integration.py`, `docs/releases/2026-02-14-platform-convergence-closeout.md`). |
