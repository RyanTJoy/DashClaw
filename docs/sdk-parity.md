# SDK Parity Matrix (Node vs Python)

Baseline parity for critical SDK capabilities, derived from:

- `sdk/dashclaw.js`
- `sdk-python/dashclaw/client.py`

## Snapshot Summary

- Node public methods: `98+`
- Python public methods: `98+`
- Current parity (method-level, normalized by Node surface): `100%`

## WS5 M2 Critical Domain Delta (February 14, 2026)

Python SDK additions shipped for critical domains:

- Actions/Approvals:
  - `approve_action`
  - `get_pending_approvals`
- Guard:
  - `get_guard_decisions`
- Webhooks:
  - `get_webhooks`
  - `create_webhook`
  - `delete_webhook`
  - `test_webhook`
  - `get_webhook_deliveries`

Validation coverage:

- `sdk-python/tests/test_ws5_m2_parity.py`

## WS5 M3 Context/Memory/Messages Delta (February 14, 2026)

Python SDK additions shipped for WS5 M3 domains:

- Context:
  - `close_thread`
  - `get_threads`
  - `get_context_summary`
- Messages:
  - `mark_read`
  - `archive_messages`
  - `broadcast`
  - `create_message_thread`
  - `get_message_threads`
  - `resolve_message_thread`
  - `save_shared_doc`
- Memory:
  - `report_memory_health` now accepts both composed report payload and split arguments.

Validation coverage:

- `sdk-python/tests/test_ws5_m3_parity.py`

## WS5 M4 Cross-SDK Integration Suite (February 14, 2026)

Cross-SDK critical-domain contract coverage is now validated against a shared harness:

- Shared fixture: `docs/sdk-critical-contract-harness.json`
- Node harness runner: `scripts/check-sdk-cross-integration.mjs` (`npm run sdk:integration`)
- Python harness test: `sdk-python/tests/test_ws5_m4_integration.py` (`npm run sdk:integration:python`)
- CI workflow steps: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`Run cross-SDK integration suite`, `Run cross-SDK Python contract suite`)

Current shared contract cases covered by the harness:

- `create_action`
- `update_outcome`
- `get_actions`
- `get_action`
- `guard`
- `get_guard_decisions`
- `report_memory_health`
- `close_thread`
- `get_threads`
- `mark_read`
- `archive_messages`
- `broadcast`
- `create_message_thread`
- `get_message_threads`
- `resolve_message_thread`
- `save_shared_doc`
- `sync_state`

## Confirmed Missing Python Methods

None — full parity achieved as of February 15, 2026.

## Full Parity Milestone (February 15, 2026)

Python SDK additions shipped to reach 100% parity:

- Dashboard Data:
  - `report_token_usage`, `create_calendar_event`, `record_idea`
- User Preferences (6 methods):
  - `log_observation`, `set_preference`, `log_mood`, `track_approach`, `get_preference_summary`, `get_approaches`
- Daily Digest:
  - `get_daily_digest`
- Security Scanning:
  - `scan_content`, `report_security_finding`, `scan_prompt_injection`
- Agent Pairing:
  - `create_pairing`, `wait_for_pairing`, `get_pairing`
- Identity Binding:
  - `register_identity`, `get_identities`
- Organization Management:
  - `get_org`, `create_org`, `get_org_by_id`, `update_org`, `get_org_keys`
- Activity Logs:
  - `get_activity_logs`

New Node SDK methods added in the same release:
- Identity Binding: `registerIdentity`, `getIdentities`
- Organization Management: `getOrg`, `createOrg`, `getOrgById`, `updateOrg`, `getOrgKeys`
- Activity Logs: `getActivityLogs`
- Webhooks: `getWebhooks`, `createWebhook`, `deleteWebhook`, `testWebhook`, `getWebhookDeliveries`

## Notes

- Python method naming uses `snake_case`; Node uses `camelCase`.
- Critical-domain payload/path contract parity is validated by the shared integration harness listed above.
- All 21 categories now have full parity between Node and Python SDKs.

## Version Compatibility Policy

- Compatibility guarantee scope:
  - Node `sdk/dashclaw.js` and Python `sdk-python/dashclaw/client.py` remain contract-compatible for the WS5 critical domains listed in the integration harness.
- Breaking changes policy:
  - Any critical-domain request-path or payload-shape breaking change requires:
    - RFC entry in `docs/rfcs/`
    - parity harness update
    - release note entry in `docs/releases/`
- Support floor:
  - Node SDK requires Node 18+.
  - Python SDK supports Python 3.7+.
