- add a save layout option to the dashboard
- create a set of recommended layouts to organize everything on the dashboard and make it look clean
- Change the tiles so that there is never 2 scroll bars inside a single tile on the dashboard
- when an agent is added to DashClaw make sure they automatically appear in the Swarm Intelligence, even if they haven't interacted with anyone yet.
- Create a "run security check" button in the security tab and create what the button should do to check that everything is secure.
- There is a bug in the Policies tab for Risk Threshold where you can't delete the 0 so when you type it says 050 for example instead of 50.
- In the Policies tab show the list of policies in a policy pack when selecting
- Include the ability to backtest past actions with the run tests for various policies in the policies tab, it also says undefined FAILURES when I tested it with 0 policies, 0 tests so make sure it's working.
- In the Policies tab the generate markdown and generate JSON button produces an output however the output is not in properly formatted markdown or properly formatted JSON
- In the Inbox for messages when I hit "Mark as Read" for broadcast messages it makes it so they are read briefly then the unread circle immediately pops back up on the message, it is perpetually unable to be marked as read.
- In the messages tab specifically the docs make it so that you can download the document as a pdf, word document, or excel file as well as keep the download .md option.
- In the workspace tab The Overview tab says "Failed to fetch digest"
- The Preferences tab in the workspace tab is 0 for observations and blank for everything else, I want that populated during the bootscript.
- Include the ability to delete tasks out of the task queue in the task routing tab.
- In the compliance tab when you expand a control all other controls expand with it instead of only the control you clicked, fixed that so only the clicked control expands.
- Also in the compliance tab the generate markdown and JSON compliance report button does not create properly formatted JSON or Markdown, it produces an output but it is not formatted correctly.
- Do a better job of importing content during the bootscript, many files are missing.
- In the relationships tab there are a lot of relationships that aren't relationships they are merely info about the agent. Instead of relationships let's call it contacts and change the layout completely and make it so that there are contacts of people or agents that the agents know and under each contact there is information about the contact.
- In relationships when you click view hot leads, or due follow-ups, or search contacts an interactive gui or something should open as opposed to the command copied message. The users will not be entering any commands they need to use do everything through a GUI.
- Add the ability to share decisions and lessons via other agents in the swarm so it is easy to teach agents lessons from other agents. Let's actually add that as a capability and feature the ability for agents to share what they learn with either select agents or the entire swarm via a broadcast message.
- The quick actions at the bottom of learning need to be interactable through the gui as opposed to copying commands similar to the relationships issue, users need to interact via a GUI.
- Each one of my agents uploaded 500+ goals which is absurd, the logic behind the boot up script must be improved because neither agent should have 500+ goals I don't know where the goals were pulled from.
- The token budget needs to be customizable through the gui with daily budgets, weekly budgets, and monthly budgets since each user and agent will have different budgets.
- The token budget is not functioning properly, there is nothing being displayed. Brainstorm ways to capture or estimate token usage, we don't have to be perfect just close enough.
- In the integration page after I tested an API key it worked, however once I saved the setting and went back to the integration to test it again the API key was dramatically shorter and no longer worked. Make sure we keep the API key in there and don't shorten it. Let's also restrict this page to admin only not user to keep the keys safe.
- For webhooks include some common webhooks that enterprises could use as templates.
- For workflows include some common workflows that enterprises could use as templates.
- Remove Bounty Hunter entirely it is not a professional thing, replace it with bug hunter where you can assign a specific agent to look for bugs or missing data throughout the platform.
- Under calendar include the ability to create events and assign various agents to the events along with specific tasks with the option to assign policies to the tasks.
- When you are scrolled all the way to the bottom of the left sidebar and you click something, the scroll location resets to back at the top instead of staying where it was before the click, update this because it makes the entire sidebar revert back to the starting point which doesn't make sense.
