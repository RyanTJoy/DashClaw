● This is solid feedback overall, but it's written by someone who doesn't know your codebase or what you've already
  built. Some of it is spot-on, some is redundant with what exists, and some is scope creep disguised as strategy.
  Here's my breakdown:

  ---
  Implement (High leverage, aligns with what you have)

  1. Global Risk Status Bar
  You already have risk signals infrastructure. Adding a thin persistent bar (1 Critical | 2 Amber | Stable) at the
  top of the dashboard layout is a small change with outsized impact. It makes the product feel alive and gives
  instant situational awareness. This is probably a half-day of work.

  2. Timeline View (merging actions + open loops)
  You already have actions, open loops, approvals, and learning data flowing through the API. A chronological
  timeline that stitches these together per-agent is genuinely the #1 debugging UX improvement for agent builders.
  This is the "Agent Flight Timeline" idea but scoped practically — not a new product, just a new tab/view that
  renders existing data chronologically.

  3. Cost Prediction (not just tracking)
  You already have cost analytics and token tracking. Adding a simple linear projection ("at current burn rate, 24h
  cost = $X") is a few lines of math on top of data you already collect. High perceived value, minimal effort.

  4. Feature Reframing on Marketing Site
  The copy advice is correct. "Know exactly why your agent made a decision" lands harder than "Telemetry ingestion."
   This is pure content work, no code. Worth doing in a pass over the landing page.

  5. System State Badge
  Replacing or augmenting the LIVE indicator with a computed state (STABLE / DRIFTING / ALERT) derived from your
  existing risk signals is clever. Small change, big perception shift. Makes the dashboard feel like it's thinking,
  not just displaying.

  ---
  Consider (Good ideas but scope/timing dependent)

  6. Mission Control Screen
  The concept is right — a high-level strategic overview that's simpler than the current ops dashboard. But this is
  a full new page with design work, not a weekend project. I'd implement items 1, 2, 3, and 5 first because they
  collectively turn the existing dashboard into Mission Control without building a separate screen. If after those
  changes you still feel a gap, then scope a dedicated /mission-control route.

  7. Before/After Visual on Landing Page
  Good marketing move, but only after the dashboard actually has the timeline and status bar. Don't screenshot what
  doesn't exist yet.

  8. Agent Persona Sections on Landing
  ("For autonomous research agents", "For enterprise copilots") — useful for conversion but requires you to actually
   know your buyer segments. If you have that clarity, add it. If not, it'll feel generic.

  ---
  Ignore (Scope creep, premature, or wrong for your stage)

  9. Risk Heatmap / Swarm Map with Force-Directed Graph
  This looks incredible in Dribbble screenshots and is a nightmare to build well. Force-directed network
  visualizations require: a graph layout engine, real-time WebSocket updates, meaningful edge/node semantics, and
  good performance. You'd spend weeks on this for a feature most users won't have enough agents to make interesting.
   Revisit when customers actually run swarms of 10+ agents.

  10. Memory Health Score
  Cool concept but inventing metrics like "prompt entropy" and "context bloat" requires research into what those
  numbers actually mean and how to compute them meaningfully. This is a feature that sounds great in a pitch deck
  and ships as a meaningless number. Skip unless you have real data science behind it.

  11. One-Click Replay Sandbox
  "Clone Session -> Run in Safe Mode" with mock tools and stripped external actions is essentially building a
  parallel execution runtime. This is a product unto itself. Massive engineering effort. Not worth it until you have
   users actively requesting it.

  12. Live Demo with Fake Swarm Activity (animated)
  You already have a demo mode with fixture data at /demo. Adding real-time animation (agents looping, violations
  firing) is polish that only matters if your landing page is your primary acquisition channel and you're optimizing
   conversion. Premature optimization for a product still establishing PMF.

  13. "Above the Fold Needs a Clear Enemy"
  The "Your agents are running blind" fear-based messaging works for mature markets. Agent observability is still
  early — most visitors are exploring what's possible, not feeling pain yet. Lead with capability and vision, not
  fear. This advice is borrowed from SaaS playbooks that don't map cleanly here.

  The best advice in that entire document is the positioning insight: "operational command center" not "devtool."
  That's correct and should inform every UI decision. But you get there incrementally through the small changes
  above, not by building a cinematic new screen from scratch.

  Want me to start implementing any of these?
